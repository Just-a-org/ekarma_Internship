		<h1>What is HTML5?</h1>
		<p>
			HTML5 is the fifth version of HTML. This version was released in 2014.
			HTML5 comes with new and advanced features. It allows developers to build
			animations and simple to complex applications that run on the browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML5 can help developers build web apps, which are developed for
			Entertainment, Online streaming, Video players, Audio players, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the previous versions, for video playback and drag-and-drop features,
			users had to depend on third-party browser plug-ins, like Adobe Flash.
			However, HTML5 offers all these features to the users along with many
			other new features and HTML attributes for building attractive websites.
			Almost all web browsers, including Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox
			Microsoft Edge, and mobile browsers, such as Android and iOS support most
			of the HTML5 features.
